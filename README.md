# Predicting Fare Amount with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the fare amount for Uber rides using machine learning algorithms. The prediction is based on input features including passenger count, distance, and the day of the week.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical Uber ride data, including information on ride fares and features such as passenger count, distance, and ride day of the week. The dataset has been preprocessed to ensure data quality.
